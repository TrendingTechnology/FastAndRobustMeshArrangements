# Fast and Robust Mesh Arrangements using Floating-point Arithmetic

This is a **WORK-IN-PROGRESS** version of the code we used for the experiments in the paper "**Fast and Robust Mesh Arrangements using Floating-point Arithmetic**" by G. Cherchi, M. Livesu, R. Scateni and M. Attene (ACM TOG, SIGGRAPH Asia 2020). 

|:warning: WARNING: We are rewriting portions of this code to be more efficient. The code is therefore subject to continuous updates. |
